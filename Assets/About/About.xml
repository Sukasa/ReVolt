  <Description>
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersLaunchPad Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
    See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad

    [h1]âš¡ Re-Volt âš¡[/h1]

    Re-Volt is an electrical overhaul mod for Stationeers, which mildly overhauls how power is distributed, what happens when things go wrong, and gives you more tools to control your power!

    [h2]ðŸ”Œ Features[/h2]

    [b]Electrical load is now proportionally shared among all sources on a cable network![/b]  No longer will you have to deal with one battery draining while the others are completely full!

    [b]Wires no longer burn out instantly![/b]  Instead, wires will burn out with a random chance, based on how much you're overloading them.  It never made sense that a cable which could carry 5,000 watts continuously would violently rupture in half a second when carrying 5,001 watts.  And now it doesn't.

    [b]Stationary batteries are now charge- and discharge-rate limited.[/b]  A single battery isn't going to take 100kW anymore, and these babies can discharge a fair bit quicker than they charge.  You might need to re-design your power distribution, or use a few more batteries in parallel!

    [b]Fuses still work.[/b]  As long as there is a fuse rated low enough to protect the cable, that fuse will ALWAYS blow instead of a cable.  And fuses blow instantly, no time delay.

    [b]Complex/recursive electrical networks are allowed.[/b]  With the revised power simulation, the limit on transformers or batteries in recursive networks has been lifted.  Over-engineer your bases to your heart's delight!.

    [h2]ðŸ“… Future Plans[/h2]

    In future, there are a few more components planned out:
    [list]
    [*] Either reversed small breakers, or [b]bi-directional breakers[/b].  I'm not sure which, yet.
    [*] Heavy Breakers, capable of interrupting much larger amounts of power
    [*] Smart variants of both, able to be monitored and controlled over the data network!
    [/list]

    [h1]ðŸ§¾ Credits[/h1]

    Nothing is ever born in a vacuum, and neither was this mod.  HUGE thanks to a number of folks in the Stationeers Modding Discord, and of course to Rocketwerkz for just being as awesome as they are.

    [h2]ðŸ†˜ Need Support?[/h2]

    If you need support, you can reach out here or on the Stationeers Modding Discord, in the Re-Volt project post, or on the Github repository at https://github.com/sukasa/revolt
